# stats220

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Arts majoring in Statistics and Economics.
- I am taking STATS 220 because it looks like a fun course where I could learn some programming stuff.
- I am interested in learning about how statistics could be used in programming.
